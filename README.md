# SVG clock

![SVG clock](clock.svg)

## Technical details

SMIL-based animation

JavaScript to set current time

GitHub sanitizes JavaScript but keeps SMIL-based animation in SVG, so **what you see on GitHub README.md page is an animated clock starting from 00:00**. If you open the SVG file directly in your browser, the animated clock should start from the current time.

## Design

Yes it's highly similar to a [Swiss railway clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_railway_clock) whose design is copyrighted ([Apple paid $21 million for it](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/apple-paid-21-million-for-swiss-railways-clock-2012-11)).
